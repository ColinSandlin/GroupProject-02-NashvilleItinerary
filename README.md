###### You've found the gruntWorks "Welcome to Nashville" app a.k.a. My Nashville Itinerary. This is an app that utilizes several APIs to let you build an itinerary while you're visiting Nashville. Here's your steps for building your own good times:

  - Use the search fields and the directions in the placeholders to find a park, a restaurant, a meet-up and a concert
  - After you hit search, your results will display below the search field, replacing any seaches you've made before
  - Each of your results will have a save button which you can use to place that event or place into your itinerary
  - If you'd like to replace any item, all you have to do is create another set of seach results in that category and select your new destination
  - Then the only left to do is HAVE FUN!

# Follow the Steps Below to Download and Use Our App

  1. Clone our repository to your local computer
  2. Next navigate to the "lib" directory
